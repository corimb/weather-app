## Weather App React

This is a personal project where I've been practicing how to manage the render of two different APIs and add those different locations to a favorites list in the localStorage.

In this App you can:

-   check the weather in your current location 🌍
-   search the meteorologic conditions in a different city 🔍
-   add the ones you want to review more often to your favorites list ❤️

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Install dependencies 🔧

```
npm i
```

See the project in your local browser:

```
npm start
```
